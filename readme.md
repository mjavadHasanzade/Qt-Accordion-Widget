# User Guide for Accordion Widget Project

## Overview
This project implements a customizable Accordion widget using Qt. The Accordion widget allows users to expand and collapse sections of content, providing a clean and organized way to display information.

## Features
- Multiple Accordion sections can be created.
- Each Accordion section can contain various widgets.
- Smooth animation for expanding and collapsing sections.
- Customizable titles for each Accordion section.

## Requirements
- Qt framework (version compatible with the code)
- C++ compiler

## File Structure
- `accordion.h`: Header file for the Accordion class.
- `accordion.cpp`: Implementation file for the Accordion class.
- `mainwindow.h`: Header file for the main window.
- `mainwindow.cpp`: Implementation file for the main window.

## How to Build
1. Ensure you have the Qt development environment set up.
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or your preferred IDE.
3. Build the project using the build option in your IDE.

## How to Use
1. **Creating Accordion Widgets**: In the `MainWindow` class, you can create multiple Accordion widgets by instantiating the `Accordion` class and setting a unique title for each.
   
   Example:
   ```cpp
   Accordion *accordion = new Accordion(widget);
   ```

2. **Setting Content**: You can set the content of each Accordion by creating a layout and adding widgets to it. Use the `setContentLayout` method to assign the layout to the Accordion.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   QVBoxLayout *contentLayout = new QVBoxLayout();
   contentLayout->addWidget(new QLabel("Content goes here."));
   accordion->setContentLayout(contentLayout);
   ```

3. **Running the Application**: After building the project, run the application. You will see the main window with the Accordion sections. Click on the toggle buttons to expand or collapse the sections.

## Customization
- You can customize the appearance of the Accordion by modifying the stylesheets in the `Accordion` constructor.
- Adjust the animation duration by changing the `animationDuration` parameter when creating an Accordion instance.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that all required Qt modules are included in your project.
- If you encounter build errors, check for typos or missing includes in your code.
